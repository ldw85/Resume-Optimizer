## UI Layout Adjustments

- Removed default vertical spacing (`space-y-8`) from the main content area in `OptimizerPage.tsx`.
- Removed `margin` and `padding` from the `.optimizer-page-container` class in `App.css` to provide more control over the layout and remove unwanted spacing around the main content.
